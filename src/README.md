# We need to be able to do four things in note creation:

## Create Notes

## Read Notes

## Update Notes

## Delete Notes

# A Note should have the following:

- title 
- description
- time created

# We should also be able to display our notes and organize our notes.

You should create a subfolder for all notes, and then just display that folder structure.
